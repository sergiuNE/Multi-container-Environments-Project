# Docker Multi-Container Environment

This repository is a cloned project from a Docker tutorial. I am using it as my candidate application for learning how to build, run, and deploy a multi-container environment in Docker.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to understand the fundamentals of:
- Building Docker images
- Running multi-container applications using Docker Compose
- Managing containers and networking
- Deploying a Dockerized application

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Future Plans
As I progress in my learning, I plan to:
- Optimize the Docker configuration
- Explore Kubernetes

## Acknowledgments
This project is based on a tutorial. Thanks to the original authors for their guidance.
